		  If the airflow from your AC is not good, there could be a few reasons why. One big reason is that the filters might be dirty or clogged. When they're dirty, they block the air, so less cool air comes out. Another reason could be that something's wrong with the fan or motor that pushes the air. Sometimes, vents or tubes can also get blocked, stopping the air from flowing properly. It's important to clean your AC regularly to avoid these problems. If you're not sure what's wrong, it's a good idea to ask a professional to check it out.
